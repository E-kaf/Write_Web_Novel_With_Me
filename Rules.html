            <h1>Stream Rules and Guidelines</h1>
            <p class="rules-intro">Here are several pointers for interested parties to keep our collaborative storytelling effective and fun:</p>

            <!-- Rule Teasers (with Learn More buttons) -->
            <div class="rules-teasers">
                <div class="rule-teaser">
                    <h2 class="rule-title">1: Ekaf Eman is the Director For Decisions (D.F.D.) and has a final say</h2>
                 <p>To keep the story coherent and moving forward smoothly, I reserve the final decision on which suggestions make it into the webnovel and when they’re implemented.</p>
                <p>I love hearing all your ideas — plot twists, characters, world details, everything! — and many will absolutely shape the tale.</p> 
                <p>However, with so many creative voices in the chat, or maybe in call, conflict is inevitable, as such I must retain the privilege of having the final say for the sake of cohesion. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-teaser">
                    <h2 class="rule-title">2: No fighting between the members of the stream</h2>
                    <p>Fighting in my stream over ideas is pointless, as even if one may "come out on top", it still doesn't mean I will aprove of it.</p>
                    <p>For your idea to pass I am the one who needs convincing, so rather than wasting energy arguing with someone who already has their mind set, look to argue to me that that idea truly is great enough to be implemented.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-teaser">
                    <h2 class="rule-title">3: Refrain from using profane language</h2>
                    <p>This really should go without saying, but using curse words and slurs will get you chat restricted, or banned.</p>
                    <p>And on a personal note, I'd like to keep the story clean of them as well, not because I have low tolerance for bad words, but more so because modern entertainment is chalkful of them, and I'd like retain some class in my writing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-teaser">
                    <h2 class="rule-title">4: Spoilers and mysteries</h2>
                    <p>If you do not wish to be spoiled on the story, then this stream is not for you. If you wish to contribute, you will be putting yourself at risk of being spoiled. That is the writers curse.</p>
                    <p>The only exceptions to this are mysteries.Things that are meant to be left to your imagination and drive speculation.</p>
                    <p>However if any member of the stream wishes to provide a mystery to the story, at the very least I, Ekaf Eman, will have to know the key behind said mystery for it to be cannon. You are not required to tell me of every single intricacy behind it, as you will be allowed to keep a few small surprises for yourself.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-teaser">
                    <h2 class="rule-title">5: Your ideas can and will be shot down</h2>
                    <p>This, is less of a rule and more of a warning.</p>
                    <p>Due to a potentially huge quantity of ideas that could be sent my way, many of you will find yourself competing for a limited space on the page.</p>
                    <p>But failure, even if constant, is something you must expect. It is something I must expect and accept. Just like there is a huge chance of me being rejected by every single agent and publisher, just like there is a huge chance that this idea of mine never manages to grow into anything substantial or fizzles out completely. 
                    <p>That is why even risking to suggest an idea is a brave step you must take. And then another. And another.</p>
                    <p>This stream is also about helping you see if you have the mental fortitude required to write.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule-teaser">
                    <h2 class="rule-title">6: No sore losers</h2>
                    <p>If you end up as someone who has their ideas getting shot down constantly, and finds it both frustrating, humiliating and offensive... Write your own book.</p>
                    <p>My writing began with frustration over how a certain story handled the defeat of their main villain and as an act of spite I decided to write, swearing I could do a better job.</p>
                    <p>If you become angry with me for whatever reason, and swear upon your life that you know and  could do better, I say "PROVE IT"!</p>
                </div>

            <p class="rules-footer-note">These rules are susceptible to changes.</p>

            <p class="rules-footer-note">Repeated rule-breaking may result in timeout or ban. Thanks for helping make this a great place to create!</p>
