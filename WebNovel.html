                <h2>Genre</h2>
                <p>
                    Epic fantasy with elements of mystery, unique magic system, expansive world-building, and character development.

                <h2>Core Premise</h2>
                 <ul class="story-features">
                    <li>In a world filled with diverse personalities, philosophies, goals and powers, one walks alone, stripped of his identity.</li>
                    <li>There he exists with vast knowledge without an ego that gave context to it.</li>
                    <li>Will he consume his time in this world in pursuit of his past, or will he embrace the present and build towards his future?</li> 
                </ul>

                <h2>What Makes This Story Special</h2>
                <ul class="story-features">
                    <li>Built live with your help — every major plot point, character decision, and world detail can be shaped by chat suggestions.</li>
                    <li>No fixed outline, aside from beginning and an end- the story evolves organically, sometimes in surprising directions.</li>
                    <li>Real-time writing: mistakes, rewrites, and "oops" moments are all part of the experience.</li>
                </ul>

                Unfortunately this feature  is not yet available due to the great deal of work needed to be implemented. (Aside from making it look like my personal wikipedia, I also desire to create an interactive map.)

                In world lore: Within the "University of Stonehead", there exists a magical meteorite, upon which should you strike your head against it, you will be imbued with vast knowledge. The reason it is not coveted by world powers, is due to its downside, where those who become enlightened may lose their old rationalities, loyalties, and goals.
